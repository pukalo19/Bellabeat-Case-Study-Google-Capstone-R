### Importing the data
```
#Reading the data
activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv",TRUE,",")
calories <- read.csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv",TRUE,",")
intensities <- read.csv("hourlyIntensities_merged.csv", TRUE, ",")
sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv",TRUE, ",")
weight <- read.csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv",TRUE, ",")
```
Now that all the data we will be using is uploaded we can start the process of cleaning the data. Lets take a look at the data and
